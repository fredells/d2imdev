d2im dev
make a easier goal: just combine all dcc dc6 cof to one to decode mpq, then based on this to make a runnable game, after this goal has been achieved, then think about some other improvement.

because the structures are pretty difficult. I can not rebuild all this system.

I decided to use all animation of d2 for the map, but for characters, I use Mir3, this is the best way. and work on lua now
